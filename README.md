# Reinforcement_Learning
A project that covers many aspects of Reinforcement Learning

In this project, I started learning anout Reinforcement Learning from Sutton and Barto 
I studied Introduction to Reinforcement Learnning, basic concepts of reinforcement learning, Exploration and Exploitation Trade-off.
I also learnt the k armed Bandit problems, Markov-Decision processes(MDPs) and Dynamic Programming.

I have solved few MDPs that the mentor had given as assignment using the Policy Iterator, Linear programming, and Value Iterator. 
I am still doing the remaining assignment.
